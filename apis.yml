  Ngrok is a service that creates secure tunnels to local servers, allowing them
  to be accessed remotely over the internet. This means that developers can
  easily test and share their web applications without having to deploy them to
  a public server. Ngrok provides a unique URL for each tunnel, making it simple
  to share the application with others for testing or demonstration purposes.
  Additionally, Ngrok offers features such as TCP tunneling, custom headers, and
  password protection to ensure secure and customizable remote access to local
  servers.
